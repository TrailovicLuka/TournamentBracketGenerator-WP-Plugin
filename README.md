Hello World!!
The idea is to create a WordPress Plugin that generates Tournament Brackets. It is necessary to enter the name of the tournament, the sport, and the type of tournament.
It is currently there with the template for the Football - Classic Tournament.
A CRUD system was created, with the help of which it is possible to get absolutely all the data entered in the fields (Name, Type of Sport, Type of Tournament. Length of Duration, Start Date, Groups and Teams in Groups).
The idea is that any developer who wants to collaborate can create a template for one sport or type of tournament.
